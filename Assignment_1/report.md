# Task 1: Evaluator for arithmetic expressions

We are to write a function eval that has type expr -> int for evaluating arithmetic expressions.

## Question 1:
Does this function need to recursively explore its argument, and why (or why not)?

## Question 2:
Why does this function have the return type int? What other return types may be suitable?

## Question 3:
How does your evaluation handle the case of division by zero? Note that it may be just fine to not special-treat division by zero, but it is important you understand what actually happens at runtime.

# Task 2: Pretty printer for arithmetic expressions

## Question 4:
Are the functions you have defined recursive, and why (or why not)?

## Question 5 (glory):
Make sure you avoid unnecessary parentheses, assuming standard precedence. Explain how you implement this.

## Question 6:
What is the OCaml type of asm_example?

## Question 7:
How would you rewrite this to use the Asm module without the local module open directive?

## Question 8:
Could we have used text instead of gtext? Why?
